# Array methods `push`, `pop`, `unshift`, `shift` in Ruby and JavaScript

Briefly describe the similarities and differences between these methods in Ruby and JavaScript.

Include differences in return value and chain-ablilty

| method                  | Differences | Similarities |
|-------------------------|-------------|--------------|
| `push`                  |             |              |
| `<<` (compare to`push`) |             |              |
| `pop`                   |             |              |
| `unshift`               |             |              |
| `shift`                 |             |              |


push / << adds the object to the end of an array in either language, but the << is only for Ruby
- returns the modify array

pop - removes element from end of array in either language, returns removed element

unshift - in RB will add element to beginning of Array.

shift - in RB AND JS will remove element from beginning of Array, and return the element


one difference between the languages is that it looks like the methods in JS are
on the prototype of Arrays, and in ruby they are just on the class.
